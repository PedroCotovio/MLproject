MLproject

Our project is divided in two main components:  3 Jupyter Notebooks and 1 Python Module 
We decided to divide our project this way to eliminate repetitive code, and to make our notebooks more readable. 
Every line of code has been documented and explained to facilitate the readability of the project.
We decomposed the project into three main tasks:
-	Exploratory data analysis
-	Supervised Learning Problems
-	Unsupervised Learning Problems
Sometimes these parts overlap a bit, but we mainly tried to separate them for easier analysis.
Inside our python module there are 3 python files that contain functions designed to mostly serve one specific notebook.
